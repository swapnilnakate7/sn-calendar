# SnCalendar

This project uses momentjs for calendar functionality. You can import the SnCalendar Module and use SnCalendarComponent straight away. Please feel free to report any bugs and I'll be happy to introduce any feature requests.

## Using into your Angular Application

- run `npm i sn-calendar` into your project root directory.
- import `SnCalendarModule` into your application.
- use `<sn-calendar>` element.
- supports `locale`, `date(Moment Object)` as input. 
- use `selectedDateOut` event to get the selected date.
